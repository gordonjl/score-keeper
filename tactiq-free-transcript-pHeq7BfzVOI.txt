00:00:00.000 this YouTube video is about scoring a
00:00:02.639 squash double skin hi I'm Lynn and Gary
00:00:06.420 is the techie and my colleague for this
00:00:08.880 project Gary what is key to a good score
00:00:12.780 the key to success is keeping an
00:00:15.000 accurate record while not disrupting the
00:00:17.340 flow of play on the court so at the end
00:00:20.279 of a match if a referee and scorer were
00:00:22.800 hardly noticed they did a great job
00:00:26.640 the main focus of this video is the role
00:00:29.820 of the scorer the scorer assists the
00:00:32.940 referee by writing down the score and
00:00:35.460 calling the score ideally how many
00:00:38.280 officials oversee a match there are four
00:00:41.340 officials a referee scorer and two line
00:00:44.520 judges
00:00:45.540 however that is ideal the majority
00:00:48.600 matches do not have four officials
00:00:51.379 so what is typical for say a league or
00:00:55.379 early rounds of a tournament
00:00:58.020 the role of score and referee are often
00:01:00.420 rolled into one
00:01:02.100 it's really great to have support online
00:01:04.199 judges so that appeals can be dealt with
00:01:06.780 this presentation focuses on writing
00:01:09.720 down the score and announcing the score
00:01:12.060 and that is the job of the score
00:01:15.420 the rules of referee and scorer are
00:01:17.820 described quite separately and are
00:01:20.520 intended to be done by two people
00:01:23.159 in the case that a score is not assigned
00:01:25.619 the referee also takes on the role of
00:01:28.259 the score what must we be aware of then
00:01:32.220 well according to squash Canada manual
00:01:35.280 the referee makes all calls and
00:01:37.619 decisions before calling the score the
00:01:40.799 scorer repeats any decisions made by the
00:01:43.439 referee practically we find this
00:01:46.439 duplication can be annoying and cause
00:01:49.500 confusion sometimes it's difficult to
00:01:52.259 find someone to oversee a match and
00:01:55.020 inexperienced player may be willing to
00:01:57.240 keep score but not take on the referee
00:02:00.659 duties in this situation just tell the
00:02:03.780 players you can keep score for them but
00:02:06.299 they make all the calls on the court
00:02:09.419 this video will help you develop skills
00:02:12.300 for the role of score
00:02:15.120 There are 16 cells following each
00:02:17.580 player's name we call that their
00:02:19.920 activity line
00:02:21.300 there is a number line at 0 to 15. we
00:02:24.420 will refer to particular columns when
00:02:26.280 data is to be entered
00:02:28.860 the essential bits of information are
00:02:31.440 coded by what and where you write
00:02:35.060 Essentials to know and record for each
00:02:37.800 point are who just served who is serving
00:02:41.280 now which Fox and what is the score as a
00:02:45.480 side wins points their entries move
00:02:47.580 along the point columns to show their
00:02:49.739 score and blocks
00:02:52.200 there are some preliminary tasks for the
00:02:54.660 score before the match begins
00:02:57.180 information on players should be
00:02:59.400 gathered well before the first serve a
00:03:02.280 good time is before or after the warm-up
00:03:04.200 period
00:03:05.220 enter the names of the teams at the top
00:03:07.200 of the sheet in team a and team boxes
00:03:09.360 for significant matches enter date Time
00:03:12.420 Event teams referee score line judges
00:03:17.280 the referee is in charge and manages
00:03:20.040 introductory matters such as getting to
00:03:22.200 know the players and identifying the
00:03:24.180 other officials
00:03:25.800 if you are both referee and scorer be
00:03:29.400 sure to let the players know the
00:03:30.900 situation regarding officials the
00:03:33.720 referee should ask the players to spin
00:03:35.940 for service in advance as well as ask
00:03:38.280 who is first hand for each team
00:03:41.340 a little time is needed to enter names
00:03:43.560 on the score sheet and should be done
00:03:45.959 ahead for subsequent Games The Winning
00:03:49.379 Side usually chooses to serve first
00:03:52.379 check with teams each game for first
00:03:55.319 hand and sides the referee is also
00:03:58.560 responsible for materials score sheets
00:04:01.440 clipboards pencils balls extra balls
00:04:05.099 those should all be available
00:04:07.500 it's a team winning the spin usually
00:04:09.360 chooses to serve
00:04:10.799 the team to served first is called the
00:04:12.900 initial side it's usually placed on the
00:04:14.939 18th with firsthand on top
00:04:17.940 the RW right wall and LW left wall are
00:04:23.580 not essential but it makes it a little
00:04:25.620 easier here to keep track of the Players
00:04:28.680 let's have a look at life scoring in the
00:04:31.620 club Locker app this is how the setup
00:04:34.199 should appear when you first begin
00:04:38.520 John Gaston when the racket Spin and are
00:04:41.699 serving first show was firsthand and
00:04:44.580 chooses to serve from the right box
00:04:46.320 enter R and chose activity line in point
00:04:50.699 column zero to show she is serving first
00:04:53.940 to begin the game we are showing what to
00:04:57.180 say in quotes what the referee calls is
00:05:01.139 above the score sheet and what the
00:05:03.780 scorer announces is below announcing the
00:05:07.139 score of a match can be different
00:05:09.120 depending on the experience of the
00:05:11.040 players The Spectators and the
00:05:13.139 significance of the match the first call
00:05:15.540 is a clear signal to players and
00:05:17.580 Spectators the match is underway
00:05:20.699 Gary give a common introduction
00:05:24.840 Cho serving from the right love all play
00:05:28.740 we will also show the score in the top
00:05:31.380 right corner in the club Locker live
00:05:33.300 scoring app
00:05:35.400 team a wins the first point
00:05:38.280 down
00:05:39.479 the referee would call the end of the
00:05:42.240 point when the ball is no longer good
00:05:44.539 down indicates the ball did not reach
00:05:47.580 the front wall fairly there are two
00:05:49.800 other common ends to a rally the call
00:05:52.620 out indicates the ball has gone out of
00:05:55.199 court I.E has touched the upper outline
00:05:59.220 or above the call not up indicates the
00:06:03.360 ball bounced twice or was scooped if you
00:06:06.780 are wearing two hats you would make one
00:06:09.840 of those three calls as the referee then
00:06:13.320 announce the score at the appropriate
00:06:15.539 time get into the habit of following the
00:06:18.419 sequence who just served knowing the
00:06:21.479 last server guides you to where the next
00:06:23.280 entry will be who is serving now
00:06:26.280 which box what is the score
00:06:29.580 who just served well troll that is where
00:06:32.639 the next entry will be made who is
00:06:34.560 serving now chol is still serving which
00:06:37.560 box left Cho must serve from the left
00:06:41.360 once the society begins serving they
00:06:44.160 must alternate service size continuously
00:06:47.699 what score enter L and chose Point
00:06:50.940 column one for clarity new entries are
00:06:54.720 in red and the previous ones turned
00:06:57.600 black be sure to complete the entries
00:07:00.060 before announcing the score don't allow
00:07:03.240 play to begin until the score is
00:07:05.280 announced ideally you should not slow
00:07:08.759 the pace of the game entering the data
00:07:11.160 quickly is crucial and be ready to
00:07:13.800 announce the score to Signal the next
00:07:16.139 serve the players will quickly judge the
00:07:18.660 competence of the official and that
00:07:20.580 matters if the server is ready to serve
00:07:24.599 and has to wait for the score call
00:07:27.180 that is not good
00:07:29.759 if the call is not concise experienced
00:07:32.880 players will notice
00:07:35.280 One Love
00:07:38.240 Timmy when's the next Point not up
00:07:42.360 follow the Box rotation so right left
00:07:45.419 right enter R and chose Point column two
00:07:49.259 as points are one the R's and L's
00:07:52.259 Advance along the point columns
00:07:55.199 two love
00:07:57.300 figure y naught two zero or two nil
00:08:02.039 well then who knows for sure but it may
00:08:04.919 be a French influence and a reference to
00:08:07.080 love for ache like goose egg when we
00:08:09.900 refer to zero or nothing we will use
00:08:12.479 terms that are preferred such as love
00:08:14.699 there are no rules for scoring but
00:08:16.919 rather guidelines that reflect best
00:08:18.660 practice
00:08:19.560 saying to zero or two nil is not wrong
00:08:22.560 but it's not common and therefore not
00:08:25.080 advised
00:08:28.620 team a wins the next point
00:08:31.020 when it's an obvious winning shot
00:08:33.479 there's no need for the ref to say
00:08:35.458 something remember the flow who just
00:08:38.039 served who's serving now which box what
00:08:41.580 is the score on Cho's activity Line
00:08:44.039 enter l in point column three
00:08:48.899 three love
00:08:52.019 team a loses the next point
00:08:55.260 team a is now side out
00:08:57.720 Team B is coming in
00:08:59.700 they chose Zoya as a first step before
00:09:02.399 the game started so she can choose a
00:09:04.740 side to serve right down side out
00:09:08.100 this referee call is made when the point
00:09:10.500 is decided and it declares a change in
00:09:14.279 server more care is needed at every
00:09:17.339 change of server the players may need a
00:09:20.040 little extra time to adjust with the
00:09:21.899 server change
00:09:23.399 who just served troll
00:09:25.980 had a slash on Cho's Point column three
00:09:28.680 to Mark the handout
00:09:31.080 team a only gets one serve to start the
00:09:34.380 game so enter a slash on Gaston's 0.3
00:09:38.580 column as handout slash for the second
00:09:42.480 server means it's side out
00:09:45.660 who's serving now
00:09:47.279 the player in the first row of Team big
00:09:50.640 is Zoya she serves fir sound which box
00:09:55.440 wait to see which service blocks Zoya is
00:09:58.920 heading towards she chooses right what
00:10:02.100 score enter R and point column one to
00:10:06.240 record team B's first point for team a
00:10:09.839 score look at the furthest point column
00:10:12.600 with an entry the last entry is three
00:10:16.560 hey everyone it's July as a score say
00:10:19.140 3-1
00:10:20.760 oh no the score is also in the order
00:10:24.600 server receiver
00:10:27.000 B team is serving and has one point a
00:10:30.300 has three points
00:10:32.760 side out one three Gary just announced
00:10:36.480 the score correctly if there are several
00:10:39.240 Spectators he could use the opportunity
00:10:42.180 to introduce Zoya Gary will give an
00:10:45.480 alternate call
00:10:47.579 soya coming in one three
00:10:52.620 teammate loses the next Point not up
00:10:55.800 continue with the alternating service
00:10:58.560 box rotation on zoya's activity Line
00:11:01.140 enter L and her Point column two
00:11:05.519 two three
00:11:08.100 in this rally Gaston hits the ball just
00:11:11.459 above the back wall line he immediately
00:11:13.740 says out thank you ball is out the
00:11:17.220 players will often in the spirit of fair
00:11:19.680 play declare if a ball is down or not up
00:11:22.680 or out
00:11:23.940 who just served Zoya who is serving now
00:11:27.360 Zoya is still serving which box right to
00:11:30.839 continue the rotation what score enter R
00:11:34.260 and zoya's point column three
00:11:37.860 three all
00:11:40.380 Gary is all another one of these
00:11:42.660 preferred terms yeah it is certainly
00:11:46.019 common rather than three each three
00:11:48.660 three or tied at three
00:11:52.399 is requested by Ariel
00:11:55.079 yes let
00:11:57.300 when a player requests to let the
00:11:59.519 referee has three options he may Grant a
00:12:03.120 let which means the point is replayed he
00:12:06.120 may deny the let which means the point
00:12:08.399 stands as played and thirdly he may
00:12:11.519 award a point to the offended team the
00:12:14.940 referee grants the requests with yes let
00:12:18.360 let given or simply let if it's denied
00:12:21.839 No Lack if awarded point to Ariel
00:12:26.459 an older term that is still used is
00:12:29.220 stroke so instead of saying point I say
00:12:33.300 stroke
00:12:35.040 then what does a score do when there is
00:12:37.560 a let requested
00:12:39.839 in this case there is no change in the
00:12:42.060 score so do nothing to the score sheet
00:12:44.459 otherwise one team or the other will get
00:12:47.040 a point just treat it like any other
00:12:49.200 point one but if you are wearing two
00:12:52.380 hats you will have to deal with the
00:12:54.720 requested let
00:12:57.380 planolette three all
00:13:00.600 Team B loses next Point down and out
00:13:05.459 soya has lost served this is a situation
00:13:09.240 when there is another change in server
00:13:11.940 Team B is still serving but now it's
00:13:14.279 second hand so who just served Zoya to
00:13:17.940 Mark the handout at a slash in zoya's
00:13:20.700 point column three who's serving Ariel
00:13:24.120 is second hand must continue the service
00:13:26.399 box rotation so it's left box what score
00:13:30.540 place an L in Ariel's Point column three
00:13:34.200 to show no change in B's points place an
00:13:37.980 X and team A's activity line to move
00:13:40.860 team A's point counter to four
00:13:44.519 hand note three four
00:13:48.540 team a wins the next Point down side out
00:13:53.040 who just served Ariel it's Saito Team B
00:13:56.760 had a slash in Ariel's Point column
00:13:59.100 three to Mark the hand and side out who
00:14:02.339 is serving Troy is coming in which Fox
00:14:06.139 wait to see which service box Troy is
00:14:09.120 choosing don't assume she'll choose
00:14:11.220 right because she started the game here
00:14:13.440 Joy this time chooses to come in on the
00:14:16.980 left what score enter L on Choice Point
00:14:20.399 column five Team B remains at three it
00:14:24.000 is a little unusual for the white Waller
00:14:26.160 to come in on the left the score May
00:14:28.380 emphasize that this is the case with
00:14:31.380 this call
00:14:32.600 Joe coming in from the left five three
00:14:38.160 Cho's service is a fault
00:14:40.980 foot fault
00:14:42.420 if you're going to call foot faults as a
00:14:44.519 referee do it consistently and do it
00:14:47.399 early in the game so players are aware
00:14:51.720 second serve five three
00:14:55.079 Cho double faults
00:14:57.180 double fault and out
00:14:59.519 who just served Joy
00:15:01.800 guess who buys the beer at a slash in
00:15:05.760 Choice Point column five to Mark the
00:15:07.980 handout who's Siri now Gaston is second
00:15:11.100 hand which Fox Gaston must serve from
00:15:14.339 the right what score enter R in Gaston's
00:15:18.360 Point column five enter an X to move
00:15:21.480 team B's point counter to four if
00:15:24.899 there's a delay like going to the front
00:15:27.000 to get the ball repeat the referees call
00:15:30.199 if no delay keep it sparse five four
00:15:36.180 the game advances to Team B serving 12
00:15:39.240 13.
00:15:40.860 a LED is requested by Ariel
00:15:43.399 noette side out
00:15:46.139 Team B loses the point who just served
00:15:49.199 Ariel at sight out Team B had a slash in
00:15:52.860 Ariel's Point column 12 to Mark the hand
00:15:55.560 inside out who is serving now Cho is
00:15:59.699 coming in which Fox Cho is heading to
00:16:02.940 the right box what score when a team
00:16:05.760 reaches 14 points the next Point could
00:16:09.420 end the game the term game ball is added
00:16:12.600 to the score
00:16:14.220 playing nolet Saito 1412 game ball
00:16:19.260 this is game one but later in the match
00:16:22.440 the next Point could not only end the
00:16:25.500 game it could end the match the term
00:16:28.380 match ball is added to the score game
00:16:30.959 ball or match ball should be announced
00:16:32.880 at the first opportunity but not for
00:16:35.160 subsequent points the two terms should
00:16:38.220 not be combined game and match ball
00:16:41.779 is not good form but it's also poor form
00:16:45.779 to say possible game ball
00:16:49.860 and the suspense continues to trolling
00:16:52.980 Gaston cinch it
00:16:54.660 or do Zoya and Ariel pull off a comeback
00:16:57.480 win
00:16:59.579 how much is too much and how little is
00:17:03.180 too little the game is for the players
00:17:06.059 not the officials some players are
00:17:08.579 annoyed with excess information the best
00:17:11.640 thing is to ask players what they prefer
00:17:14.099 do you want just the score or server
00:17:18.119 side and score for some situation that
00:17:21.179 Sparks 3-4 is not enough alternatives
00:17:25.140 are from the right three four are coming
00:17:29.580 in three four you should be sensitive to
00:17:32.880 clues that indicate a player is unsure
00:17:35.760 Ariel you're coming in at three four or
00:17:39.720 simply point to the box to be served
00:17:41.520 from
00:17:43.740 there are various ways to convey the
00:17:46.140 change in servers
00:17:47.640 we have consistently used the same terms
00:17:50.400 throughout side out five two
00:17:53.640 has a few variations Choice five two
00:17:57.320 site in 5-2 coming in 5-2 troll coming
00:18:03.299 in 5-2
00:18:05.700 we've only looked at one term side out
00:18:08.160 if you like Choice use it all the time
00:18:10.740 if you're like side out stay with it do
00:18:13.980 not mix and match the spectators are
00:18:16.799 also consideration we should make the
00:18:19.140 experience understandable and easy to
00:18:21.780 follow whatever you do being consistent
00:18:24.900 will be seen as confidence
00:18:29.039 for a final slide we'd like to offer
00:18:31.799 some hints and tips Lind what's the
00:18:33.780 first one
00:18:35.280 get into the habit
00:18:37.320 who just served who serving now which
00:18:40.679 box what is the score
00:18:43.740 keep an accurate record while not
00:18:45.600 disrupting the flow of play on the court
00:18:48.480 don't allow play to begin until the
00:18:52.080 score is announced
00:18:54.539 pick up cues from the players regarding
00:18:57.240 too much or too little to announce
00:19:01.380 don't rely on your memory
00:19:03.600 learn to read your own score sheet
00:19:08.100 keep your pencil on the cell of the
00:19:10.559 players serving
00:19:12.419 be clear and loud enough so that players
00:19:15.120 can hear what you are saying be neutral
00:19:18.240 with your tonal voice
00:19:20.340 when you don't know the players pick out
00:19:23.039 something to identify each person
00:19:26.400 Glenn do you have an example of that yes
00:19:29.100 it was a rather tense time refereeing a
00:19:32.580 match in Portland there were four guys
00:19:35.340 my age so everyone with white hair and
00:19:38.520 it was a whites only Club so everyone
00:19:40.620 dress identically and it seemed to take
00:19:43.740 forever for me to sort out which player
00:19:46.380 was which so do try to figure out who's
00:19:49.919 who before you start
00:19:52.200 and dubs they're removing bodies of
00:19:54.720 things going on at a really fast pace
00:19:57.480 after a long rally it's easy to forget
00:20:00.120 what just happened a few seconds ago
00:20:02.820 that's why the players on the court
00:20:04.620 appreciate having you there
00:20:07.320 well Liv and I hope this video builds
00:20:09.480 your confidence as a dubs score have fun
00:20:12.299 out there
