XState with a Database as Source of Record in React Apps

Managing state in a React app where a database (or persistent store) is the source of truth requires a clear separation between server data and UI state. XState – a library for state machines – excels at orchestrating UI logic and asynchronous flows, but it shouldn’t duplicate your entire database state. The best practice is to let the database (or a caching layer) be the single source-of-record for data, while using XState to drive the UI’s interactive logic. Below we outline architectural techniques and real-world examples that illustrate this approach.

Architectural Best Practices
• Single Source of Truth for Data: Keep your application’s authoritative data in one place (e.g. a LiveStore database, GraphQL cache, or React Query store) and avoid scattering it across multiple states. XState state machines should not replace your database as the source-of-truth for persistent data ￼. Instead, XState can listen to data changes and infer the state from the database values (e.g. a record’s status) as needed. This way, the database remains authoritative while XState manages the UI’s reaction to those data changes. For example, LiveStore’s integration guide suggests listening to reactive query results and emitting XState events when those results change ￼. The state machine can then trigger side-effects (like writing new mutations to the database) without maintaining its own redundant copy of the data.
• Divide Responsibilities – Server State vs UI State: Use the database or a caching library (like React Query or Apollo Client) for server state (fetched data), and use XState for UI and control state (loading spinners, wizard steps, form modes, etc.). A React community recommendation is to “keep one source of truth (e.g. React Query) for your fetched data and keep your state machines as slim as possible when handling complex interaction” ￼. In practice, this means you might fetch and cache data outside the machine, then pass references or IDs into the machine’s context. The machine can track which item is selected or whether a process is in progress, but the detailed data comes from the single source-of-truth store. This avoids duplicating large datasets inside XState context.
• Minimal Context, Derived State: Model the XState machine’s context to hold only the minimal state needed for UI logic (such as an item ID, a flag, or ephemeral form input). Avoid storing entire data records or lists if they already live in the database. For example, one developer from Kaltura notes that while XState is powerful for orchestrating flows, it is “not robust enough to store large amounts of data or manage the entire application state” – it’s better suited for small subsets of application flow or feature-specific state ￼. In other words, let XState manage which state your UI is in, but let the database store what the data is. The UI can always query the latest data from the source-of-record when needed.
• Use XState for Orchestration and Side-Effects: The strength of XState is in modeling transitions, side-effects, and async operations in a predictable way. Take advantage of XState’s actions and invoked services to handle interactions with the database:
• Use actions for “fire-and-forget” side effects that don’t affect the current state transition. For instance, logging an event or optimistically sending an update can be done in an action when a state is entered or an event occurs ￼. These actions can commit a mutation to the datastore without waiting for a response, if the result doesn’t immediately influence UI state.
• Use invoked services for operations where the outcome does affect state (loading data, saving with potential failure, etc.). XState allows you to invoke promises, callbacks, or observables and specify transitions on success (onDone) or failure (onError) ￼ ￼. For example, your machine might have a "loading" state that invokes a data fetch; on success it transitions to "success" with the data, on error to "failure". This maps naturally to handling latency and errors in UI flows.
• Fire-and-Forget vs Acknowledged Updates: When updating the database through XState, decide if you want to wait for confirmation or not. In some cases, you can fire an update and let the reactive data store or cache update the UI when the change is persisted. For instance, with Apollo GraphQL, one can invoke mutations as observables rather than promises – making them fire-and-forget – and rely on the Apollo cache subscription to update any subscribed UI or machines ￼. Similarly, with LiveStore or React Query, you might optimistically update the cache and have XState respond to the updated state. This approach keeps the machine responsive (it doesn’t stall waiting on a promise) while the source-of-truth store propagates changes to all listeners. Of course, if the outcome is critical (e.g. a payment), your machine should wait for confirmation (using onDone transitions, etc.).
• Reactive Event Feeds: Connect the database changes to the state machine via events. Since the database is the source of truth, design your system so that whenever the data changes (via user action or external sync), the XState service receives an event. LiveStore’s pattern is exactly this: “listen [to] query results and emit events when the query results change,” then let the state machine react and possibly commit further mutations ￼. In practice, this could mean subscribing to a LiveStore query or a Redux/React-Query selector in a React effect and calling send() on the machine with an appropriate event (e.g. DATA_UPDATED or ITEM_ADDED). This ensures the machine is always in sync with the real data. With XState v5’s actor model, you can even treat an external data stream as an actor (for example, using fromObservable() to subscribe to a data source) and have it directly feed events into the state machine.
• Plan for Latency and Offline: When the source-of-record is not instantly accessible (due to network latency or offline mode), incorporate states in your machine to handle this. Typically you will have states like "loading" or "saving" where the UI can show a spinner. In more complex scenarios, you can include an optimistic update path: e.g., transition to a tentative state immediately, but also have an event that rolls back if the server rejects the change. XState can queue events, so you could even implement an offline queue that stores actions while offline and replays them when connectivity returns (a community example is an “offline queue” state machine catalog for scheduling async events when offline). The key is to make these network-dependent transitions explicit in your statechart. For instance, one production app’s state machine for file uploads had a "processing" state where it polled the server until a video was transcoded, then only transitioned to "ready" when the server signaled completion ￼ ￼. This approach gracefully handles asynchronous delays by keeping the UI in an appropriate state (processing) until the source-of-truth (server) confirms the next state.
• Ensure Determinism via State Machine Paths: To avoid race conditions, funnel all changes to critical data through the state machine’s events whenever possible. Theodo engineers point out that if the entity in the database only changes via the XState machine’s transitions, the system stays safe and deterministic ￼. This means you don’t have surprise external mutations that bypass your UI logic. If other sources do modify the data, treat those like external events to the machine (as mentioned with reactive feeds). By having a single orchestrator (the machine) know about all changes, you can model consistent transitions (and even rollbacks or retries on failure).

Real-World Examples of XState with External Stores
• Kaltura’s Media Library (Video Uploads): The video management tool at Kaltura uses XState to manage the upload workflow for multiple files, while the server and database maintain the actual video status. Each file gets its own child state machine representing its upload state (idle → uploading → processing → ready, etc.), and a parent machine tracks all uploads ￼ ￼. When an upload starts, the machine invokes an external API call to actually upload the file to the server (doUpload service). On success, the machine moves to a processing state; on failure, to an error state ￼. The “processing” state then invokes another service to poll the backend (via Kaltura’s API) for the transcoding status, transitioning to the “ready” state only when the server reports success ￼ ￼. In this setup, the source-of-record for a file’s status is the backend – the XState machine simply coordinates the UI and API calls. The team found XState invaluable for keeping each file’s state explicit and handling side-effects (like API calls) in one place, while not storing heavy data in the machine (file metadata was kept in context only as needed). Once a file is fully uploaded and processed, the machine reaches a final state and even signals the parent to remove it from memory (preventing stale or heavy in-memory state) ￼ ￼. This example shows XState enabling a robust upload UI without conflating UI state with the persistent data store.
• Warehouse Item Flow (Bakken & Bæck for Pio): Design agency Bakken & Bæck rebuilt a React/Next.js app for warehouse workers using XState to handle guided workflows (like storing an item into an automated grid) ￼. They modeled each multi-step flow as a separate state machine – for example, an item storage flow had states like choosing layout, choosing product, confirming, storing, and complete ￼ ￼. The state machine context held just the small bits of data needed (selected product ID, etc.) as the user progressed, replacing the need for any global Redux store for this flow ￼. When it came time to actually execute the operation (physically storing the item via a warehouse API), the machine entered a storingBin state which invoked a call to the grid controller’s API ￼. The UI was tied to the machine’s state: React components would render different step screens based on the current state, and user actions were dispatched as events to the machine (e.g. SELECT_PRODUCT, INSERT_PRODUCT). This architecture gave the team full control over the UI navigation (preventing out-of-order steps) and a clear picture of what the app was doing at each stage. The database behind the scenes (inventory records, etc.) remained the source-of-record for item data, but XState ensured the front-end didn’t miss any steps or transitions when interacting with that data. After adopting XState, the developers reported easier maintenance and the ability to extend flows with complex branching logic that was hard to manage with their previous RxJS-based approach ￼ ￼.
• Order Processing Backend (Theodo example): State machines aren’t limited to the UI. Theodo’s blog describes a backend order workflow (e.g. food delivery order states) using XState, where the database holds the authoritative state of each order (e.g. an order’s status field) and the state machine logic runs on the server to determine transitions ￼. In their design, XState is used to calculate and enforce valid state transitions – for instance, only allowing “Prepare” -> “Out for Delivery” -> “Delivered” or “Cancel” at certain points – but whenever a transition occurs, the database is updated as the single source-of-truth for the new status ￼. This way, any service or client can trust the DB’s record while the state machine guarantees that those records only change in valid ways. The lesson here (which applies to frontends too) is that XState can act as the process manager while the persistent store remains the master record. If something else changes the DB out-of-band, the state machine can derive the state from the DB and reconcile it (though ideally all changes go through the controlled state machine events to remain deterministic). This pattern is essentially a form of event-sourcing or controlled transitions ensuring consistency between an app’s logic and its data source ￼.

In summary, using XState with a separate source-of-record database involves letting each tool do what it does best. The database (or sync layer like LiveStore) maintains canonical data and propagates changes, while XState interprets those changes and drives the UI through well-defined states and transitions. Real-world projects have successfully applied this: from React frontends handling file uploads and multi-step forms, to backend workflows coordinating multi-step processes. The key benefits include clearer separation of concerns, more predictable UI behavior (since statecharts prevent impossible states), and easier handling of asynchronous complexity (via XState’s built-in mechanisms for side-effects and concurrency). By following the best practices above – single source of truth for data, slim state machine context, and explicit handling of async events – you can achieve a “best of both worlds” architecture: a reliable database of record coupled with a robust state machine that renders and updates the UI confidently based on that record.
